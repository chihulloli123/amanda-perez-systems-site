        <p>Hi, my name is Amanda Perez. I am from Durant, OK, and a graduate of Southeastern Oklahoma State University with a degree in Computer Science. I bring over a decade of experience in customer service, guest retention, and business operations, where I frequently intervened in complex situations, resolved conflicts, and arbitrated on behalf of my organization. These responsibilities sharpened my ability to operate under pressure, balance stakeholder needs/wants, and implement sustainable processes improvement. With a strong love for technology and a background in management, servant leadership, and process optimization, I now lead Chi Hullo Li Creations LLC, where I focus on building secure, reliable digital solutions. My work is guided by a commitment to integrity, resilience, and global stewardship in technology.</p>
